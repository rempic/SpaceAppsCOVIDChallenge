# Data Traces Team | Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge

### Project

Data are becoming surrogates of our existence.  My idea for this art/data challenge is to create a video-sound installation rendering Earth/Human transformations during the pandemic using satellite data. For the final product I envision the installation to be connected in real time to the satellite data, and shown online and/or in a physical art space on large led panels running along the entire perimeter of a dark room in which the audience can have an immersive experience.
