# NASA SpaceApps COVID-19 Challenge 

### Data Traces Project | Remi Pic√≥

As a society we have learned to believe mainly in what we see.  Art has the power to show in many unconventional forms the invisible to everybody. The Data Traces Project is a mean for the revelation and communication of the invisible in a poetic form. The pandemic and pollution are two invisible killers which we a striving to fight. In the proposed video-art I render satellite N02 pollution level above Milan's area acquired from NASA OMI/Aura NO2 satellite before and during the pandemic: from 01.01 to 05.30/2020. In the video the density of the black clouds and the speed of the record in background are positively correlated with the level of N02. The song is the traditional city anthem of Milan.
