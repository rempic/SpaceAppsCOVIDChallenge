# Data Traces Team | Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge

### Project

Data are becoming surrogates of our existence. My idea for Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge  challenge is to render
Earth/Human transformations during the pandemic with a video-sound installation using satellite data

### Broad Art Concept

As a Society we have learned to belive mainly what we see. The visible brings many challenges. The pandemic and pollution 
are two invisible killer that we a striving to fight. Art is a mean to show in many forms the invisible to everybody. 
The Data Traces video-sound installion can be seen as a mean for the revelation and cominucation to everybody of the invisible.
